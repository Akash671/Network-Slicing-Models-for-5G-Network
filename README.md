Machine Learning and Deep Learning Based Network Slicing Models for 5G Network



Abstract—5G network can provide high speed data transfer
with low latency at present days. Network slicing is the prime
capability of 5G, where different slices can be utilized for
different purposes. Therefore, the network operators can utilize
their resources for the users. Machine Learning (ML) or Deep
Learning (DL) approach is recently used to address the network
issues. Efficient 5G network slicing using ML or DL can provide
an effective network. An endeavour has been made to propose
an effective 5G network slicing model by applying different ML
and DL algorithms. All the methods are adopted in developing
the model by data collection, analysis, processing and finally
applying the algorithm on the processed dataset. Later the
appropriate classifier is determined for the model subjected to
accuracy assessment. The dataset collected for use in the
research work focuses on type of uses, equipment, technology,
day time, duration, guaranteed bit rate (GBR), rate of packet
loss, delay budget of packet and slice. The five DL algorithms
used are CNN, RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, CNN-LSTM and the
four ML algorithms used are XGBoost, RF, NB, SVM. Indeed,
among these algorithms, the RNN algorithm has been able to
achieve maximum accuracy. The outcome of the research
revealed that the suggested model could have an impact on the
allocation of precise 5G network slicing.
